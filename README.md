HR by profession, Gen AI Developer by curiosity 🤝💻

B.Tech graduate in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence, currently working in Human Resources at Growhut Technologies, hiring developers by day and trying to code in Python & SQL by night so I actually understand what “production issue” means.

I enjoy bridging the gap between people and tech, asking “why?” a lot, and slowly becoming the HR person developers don’t fear.
Here to build better teams, learn to write cleaner code, and maybe one day debug something without panic.

Belief: Great products are built by great people, and a little bit of Python.
