  <i>Hiring developers by day, debugging my own code by night.</i>

<p>
B.Tech graduate in <b>Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)</b>, currently working in <b>Human Resources at Growhut Technologies</b>.
</p>

<p>
I hire developers during the day and try to code in <b>Python & SQL</b> after work so I actually understand what 
<code>“production issue”</code> means.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy bridging the gap between <b>people and tech</b>, asking “why?” a lot, and slowly becoming the <b>HR person developers don’t fear</b>.
</p>

<p>
Here to build better teams, learn to write cleaner code, and maybe one day debug something <i>without panic</i> 😌
